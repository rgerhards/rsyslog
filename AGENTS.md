# AGENTS.md – rsyslog Repository Agent Guide

This file defines guidelines and instructions for AI assistants (e.g., Codex, GitHub Copilot Workspace, ChatGPT agents) to understand and contribute effectively to the rsyslog codebase.

---

## Repository Overview

- **Primary Language**: C  
- **Build System**: autotools (`autogen.sh`, `configure`, `make`)  
- **Modules**: Dynamically loaded from `modules/`  
- **Contributions**: Additional modules and features are placed in `contrib/`, which contains community-contributed plugins not actively maintained by the core rsyslog team. These are retained in `contrib/` even if adopted later, to avoid disruptions in dependent software.  
- **Documentation**: Maintained in a separate repository ([rsyslog-doc](https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog-doc))  
- **Child Projects**:
  - [`rsyslog-docker`](https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog-docker): Provides prebuilt container environments for development and CI
- **Side Libraries** (each in its own repo within the rsyslog GitHub org):
  - [`liblognorm`](https://github.com/rsyslog/liblognorm)
  - [`librelp`](https://github.com/rsyslog/librelp)
  - [`libestr`](https://github.com/rsyslog/libestr)
  - [`libfastjson`](https://github.com/rsyslog/libfastjson): A fork of libfastjson by the rsyslog project, optimized for speed. This library is used by multiple external projects.

---

## Development Workflow

### Base Repository
- URL: https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog
- **Default base branch: `master`**  
  > For technical reasons, `master` is still the default branch. Numerous scripts and CI workflows rely on this name.

### Contributor Workflow
1. Fork the repository (for personal development)
2. Create a feature/fix branch
3. Push changes to your fork
4. Open a **pull request directly into `rsyslog/rsyslog:master`**

> **Important**: AI-generated PRs must target the `rsyslog/rsyslog` repository directly.

---

## Branch Naming Conventions

There are no strict naming rules, but these conventions are used frequently:

- For issue-based work: `i-<issue-number>` (e.g., `i-2245`)
- For features or refactoring: free-form is acceptable
- For AI-generated work: prefix the branch name with the AI tool name  
  (e.g., `gpt-i-2245-json-stats-export`)

---

## Coding Standards

- **Use tabs, not spaces** for indentation — enforced via CI
- Commit messages **must include all relevant information**, not just in the PR
- Commit message titles **must not exceed 70 characters**
- When referencing GitHub issues, use the **full GitHub URL** to assist in `git log`-based reviews
- Favor **self-documenting code** over excessive inline comments
- Public functions should use Doxygen-style comments
- Modules must implement and register `modInit()` and `modExit()`

When fixing compiler warnings like `stringop-overread`, explain in the commit message:
- Why the warning occurred
- What part of the code was changed
- How the fix prevents undefined behavior or aligns with compiler expectations
- Optionally link: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html#index-Wstringop-overread

### Code Style Rules Enforced by `devtools/check-whitespace`:

- Lines **must end with a single LF** (no missing or extra newlines)
- **Maximum line length**: 120 columns (tab width = 8 spaces)
- **No leading space** at beginning of line (except for ` *` in comments)
- **No trailing whitespace** at line end
- **DOS CRLF format is not permitted**

### Structured Error Handling Convention

- Use `ABORT_FINALIZE(code);` to both set `iRet = code` and jump to `finalize`.
- Use `FINALIZE;` when exiting with the current `iRet` value.
- Use `DEFiRet` at the beginning of a function to define `iRet`.
- Use the label `finalize_it:` to mark the exception return point.
- Return using `RETiRet`.
- Use `CHKiRet()` to check a function's return and jump to `finalize_it` on failure.
- Use `CHKmalloc()` and similar macros to verify allocations or calls.
- `localRet` is a temporary `rsRetVal` for intermediate error evaluation.

---

## Testing & Validation

rsyslog uses a custom test driver and has complex build dependencies.

### Test Framework

- All test definitions are located in the `/tests` directory.
- The test execution framework is implemented in `tests/diag.sh`.
- Tests are driven via `make check`, which wraps around `diag.sh`.

Each test file in `tests/` is a standalone bash script that is executed independently. These scripts typically begin by sourcing `tests/diag.sh`, which provides a shared library of functions and utilities for test execution and validation.

> Test execution is resource-intensive. Limit concurrency (`make check -j4` or less) to avoid unreliable results.

To run `make check`, you **must configure with `--enable-testbench`**. The test suite includes many test cases and may run for 10+ minutes. To save time, prefer targeting individual tests by name. Tests with filenames containing "basic" are typically good candidates for quick validation.

Some extended tests involving external components (e.g., daemons or network services) may be flaky due to timing conditions. When a test fails but passes on re-run, it's usually a nondeterministic issue. Such behavior should be reviewed but does not always indicate a defect.

The `imdiag` module exists specifically to support the test framework and is used for command and information passing during tests.

When a test fails, **read the referenced `tests/test-suite.log`** file to analyze failure details.

---

### Recommended Test Environment

Use prebuilt container environments provided by [`rsyslog-docker`](https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog-docker):

- They contain all required libraries and tools
- CI-like workflows can be reproduced locally
- Support full configuration flexibility (Valgrind, tsan, sanitizers, etc.)

> If only a single test run is planned, the best container to use is:  
> `rsyslog/rsyslog_dev_base_ubuntu:24.04`

GitHub Actions and other CI systems use these containers. Test execution typically takes 10–40 minutes per runner depending on the suite.

---

### Manual Setup (discouraged)

Minimum setup requires:

- Autotools toolchain: `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`, `make`, `gcc`
- Side libraries: `libestr`, `librelp`, `libfastjson`, `liblognorm` (must be installed or built manually)

Example commands:

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-debug --enable-testbench
make -j$(nproc)
make check
```

Use `make check -j2` or `-j4` max for reliability.

---

### Codex Build Environment Setup

Codex-based agents must only perform this setup **if a compile or test is required** (e.g., not for review-only tasks):

- Run this setup script to install core dependencies:
  ```bash
  ./devtools/codex-setup.sh
  ```
- Then, always run:
  ```bash
  ./autogen.sh
  ```

This ensures Codex can build core components even in constrained environments. Skipping setup when not needed (e.g., code review) saves significant execution time.

## Documentation

Main documentation is in a separate repo:  
https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog-doc

To build locally:

```bash
cd rsyslog-doc
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```

If a feature changes user-facing behavior or configuration:
- Update the appropriate section in `rsyslog-doc`
- Link it in your PR and commit message

---

## Pull Request & Commit Guidelines

- PR title should be concise and informative  
- PR body should describe what changed, why, how it was tested, and any caveats
- **Commit messages must be complete** — assume the reader only has the git log
- **Commit title must not exceed 70 characters**
- Link relevant GitHub issues using the full URL (e.g., `https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/1234`)
- Use a single logical commit unless there's a clear need to split

---

## AI-Specific Hints

- The `modules/` directory contains dynamically loaded input/output plugins  
- `contrib/` contains external contributions (e.g. plugins) that are not core-maintained  
- `statsobj.c` implements the statistics interface  
- `imhttp` provides HTTP input and optionally Prometheus metrics  
- Use `doc/` only for legacy inline docs — modern documentation lives in `rsyslog-doc`
- You may reference `rsyslog-docker` for dev/test environment setup
- Side libraries are external GitHub repos, not subdirectories

When generating or editing code, prefer:
- Clean modular design  
- Compatibility and backward safety  
- Updating structured comments (e.g., Doxygen)

---

## AI Agent Commit Convention

If you are an AI agent contributing code or documentation:

- Include a **commit footer tag** like:
  ```
  AI-Agent: Codex 2025-06
  ```
- PR descriptions should clearly identify that they were generated or co-authored by an AI tool.
- Avoid generating multiple PRs for retries — reuse and update the original PR when possible.
- Follow the same **commit message policy** as human contributors: describe what changed, why, and how it was validated.

---

## Privacy, Trust & Permissions

- AI agents **must not** push changes directly to user forks — always open PRs against `rsyslog/rsyslog`
- Do not install third-party dependencies unless explicitly approved
- PRs must pass standard CI and review checks
- All code **must be reviewed manually**; AI output is subject to full review
