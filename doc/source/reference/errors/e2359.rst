.. _error-e2359:

E/2359 - Action resumed
=======================

:Category: Flow control / recovery
:Primary impact: Output resumes; queues drain
:Typical environments: Any action after a transient failure (e.g., network, I/O)
:Introduced: by 8.0 (present in all 8.x+)
:Related: :ref:`error-e2007`, :ref:`error-e2027`

**Quick triage**

- Confirmation signal: the previously suspended action is active again.  
- Check queue depth and recent logs to ensure the underlying issue is **truly resolved** (not flapping).

**Most common root causes**

- Prior network outage or TLS error cleared (receiver back up, firewall opened).  
- Prior I/O issue fixed (disk space restored, permissions corrected).  
- Pipeline restarted or recovered after transient errors.

**Fixes**

- None required if conditions are now healthy.  
- If flapping, investigate the preceding **suspend** reason (``E/2007`` or ``E/2027``) and stabilize the path.

**Why it happens**

When an action leaves suspend state, rsyslog emits ``E/2359`` as a **positive edge**.
It pairs with the earlier failure (usually ``E/2007``) and indicates the retry loop succeeded.
