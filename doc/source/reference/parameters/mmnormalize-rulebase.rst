This parameter applies to :doc:`../../configuration/modules/mmnormalize`.

:Name: ruleBase
:Scope: action
:Type: word
:Default: none
:Required?: yes
:Introduced: at least 6.1.2, possibly earlier

Description
-----------
Specifies which rulebase file to use. If there are multiple mmnormalize
instances, each one can use a different file. However, a single instance can
use only a single file. This parameter or :ref:`param-mmnormalize-rule` MUST be given, because
normalization can only happen based on a rulebase. Normalization itself is
performed by `liblognorm <https://www.liblognorm.com/>`_; see the
`liblognorm configuration documentation <https://www.liblognorm.com/files/manual/configuration.html>`_
for details on creating and managing rulebases.
