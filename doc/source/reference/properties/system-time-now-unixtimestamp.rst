:Name: $now-unixtimestamp
:Category: Time-Related System Properties
:Type: integer

Description
-----------
  The current time as a unix timestamp (seconds since epoch). This actually
  is a monotonically increasing counter and as such can also be used for any
  other use cases that require such counters. This is an example of how
  to use it for rate-limiting::

    # Get Unix timestamp of current message
    set $.tnow = $$now-unixtimestamp

    # Rate limit info to 5 every 60 seconds
    if ($!severity == 6 and $!facility == 17) then {
      if (($.tnow - $/trate) > 60) then {
        # 5 seconds window expired, allow more messages
        set $/trate = $.tnow;
        set $/ratecount = 0;
      }
      if ($/ratecount > 5) then {
        # discard message
        stop
      } else {
        set $/ratecount = $/ratecount + 1;
      }
    }

  NOTE: by definition, there is no "UTC equivalent" of the
  $now-unixtimestamp property.
