Reports the DNS-resolved name of the host that sent the message to rsyslog.

.. summary-end

This property belongs to the **Message Properties** group.

:Name: fromhost
:Category: Message Properties
:Type: string

Description
-----------
Hostname of the system the message was received from (in a relay chain, this
is the system immediately in front of rsyslog and not necessarily the original
sender). This is a DNS-resolved name, except if that is not possible or DNS
resolution has been disabled. Reverse lookup results are cached; see
:ref:`reverse_dns_cache` for controlling cache timeout. Forward lookups for
outbound connections are not cached by rsyslog and are resolved via the system
resolver whenever a connection is made.

Usage
-----
.. _properties.message.fromhost-usage:

.. code-block:: rsyslog

   template(name="show-fromhost" type="string" string="%fromhost%")
