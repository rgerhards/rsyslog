## rsyslog base container for Alpine

**Deprecated**

This image provides rsyslog with a small set of frequently used modules on top of Alpine Linux and was originally meant as a building block for custom containers.

Development has moved to Ubuntu-based images to better integrate with our daily stable packages. Alpine files are kept only for historical reference.
