## rsyslog base container for CentOS 7

**Deprecated**

This image supplies rsyslog with common modules on CentOS 7 and was mainly intended as a base for specialized containers.

We now focus on Ubuntu-based images for better package integration. The CentOS files are preserved only for historical reference.
