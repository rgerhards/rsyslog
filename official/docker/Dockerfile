# docker/Dockerfile
# Dockerfile for rsyslog/official-docker
# This container specializes in gathering logs from the Docker daemon via imdocker
# and forwarding them to a central collector.

# Build arguments passed from the Makefile.
# BASE_IMAGE_TAG will be the full tag of the minimal image (e.g., rsyslog/official-minimal:2025-04).
ARG BASE_IMAGE_TAG
ARG UBUNTU_VERSION="24.04" # Inherited from base, but good to keep for consistency/labels
ARG RSYSLOG_IMG_VERSION="unset" # Version passed from Makefile for image metadata

# Use the rsyslog/official-minimal image as the base.
# This ensures all the core rsyslog setup (PPA, basic install, permissions) is inherited.
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE_TAG}

# Re-declare ARGs after FROM to make them available to subsequent instructions like LABEL.

# This module is necessary to read logs directly from the Docker daemon's logging driver.
# apt-get update is run to ensure the package lists are fresh before installing.

# Copy the Docker-specific rsyslog configuration snippet.
# This snippet will typically configure imdocker to listen on the Docker socket
# and forward logs to your central collector.
# Using a numerical prefix (e.g., 10-) ensures load order if multiple snippets are added.
COPY 30-docker.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/30-docker.conf


# Inherit CMD from base image:
# The CMD from the base rsyslog/official-minimal container will be automatically inherited.
# This is ideal as the base already provides the correct command to run rsyslogd in the foreground
# using the main rsyslog.conf, which in turn includes files from /etc/rsyslog.d/.
# No explicit CMD instruction is needed here.
